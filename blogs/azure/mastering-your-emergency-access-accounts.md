# The Unsung Heroes of IT: Mastering Your Emergency Access Accounts

In the world of IT, we plan for the best but prepare for the worst. System outages, security incidents, or even just a critical administrator being unavailable – these are scenarios that can bring operations to a halt.

Emergency access accounts (often called “break-glass” accounts) serve as a critical backup, providing guaranteed access to your environment when normal administrative accounts are locked out, blocked by Conditional Access, or otherwise unavailable.

However, with great power comes great responsibility. If not managed meticulously, these accounts can become significant security vulnerabilities.

So, how do you ensure these critical access points are ready when you need them, yet secure from misuse?

It boils down to a combination of **smart technical configurations** and **rigorous, regular reviews**.


## Setting the Stage: Technical Safeguards for Emergency Accounts

Before we even get to manual checks, let's ensure our environment is set up to handle these accounts with the caution they deserve:

### • Strategic Exclusions from Conditional Access

Your everyday Conditional Access policies (enforcing MFA, device compliance, location checks) are vital for general security. However, emergency accounts often need to bypass these.

- **Why?** In an emergency, the very systems enforcing these policies (like MFA providers) might be the ones that are down.
- **How?** Carefully configure exclusions for only these designated emergency accounts. Consider automation to manage these exclusions, perhaps by adding accounts to an exclusion group temporarily and then automatically removing them after a predefined period. **Regular audits** of these exclusions are non-negotiable.


### • Sound the Alarm: Robust Alerting is Key

Any use of an emergency access account is a significant event. It must trigger **immediate alerts**.

- **Why?** You need to know instantly if these accounts are being used, whether legitimately or maliciously.
- **How?** Configure high-priority alerts in your SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system or identity provider (e.g., **Microsoft Entra ID Protection**, **Microsoft Sentinel**). These alerts should go straight to your security operations team and include details like:
  - Timestamp
  - Source IP
  - Actions performed


### • Considering IP Whitelisting (With Caution)

One common thought is to restrict emergency account access to only your organization's known IP addresses.

- **The Pro:** Adds a layer of security by preventing external login attempts.
- **The Con:** What if the emergency is that your organizational network is down or your office is inaccessible? This restriction could **lock you out** when you need access most.
- **Recommendation:** If you implement IP restrictions, have a **rock-solid, well-tested procedure** to temporarily and securely lift this restriction during a declared emergency. This change itself should also be an **auditable, alert-generating event**.


## The Cornerstone: Your Quarterly Emergency Account Access Review

Technical controls are a great start, but they aren't "set it and forget it." A disciplined, **regular review process** is crucial. We recommend a **quarterly review**, encompassing the following steps:


### Phase 1: Prepare for Validation

- **Heads-Up!** Notify your security monitoring staff. You don't want your testing to trigger a real-world incident response.
- **Gather Your Intel:** Collect all relevant documentation – the list of currently authorized individuals, the documented emergency access procedures, etc.


### Phase 2: Review People and Paperwork – The Human Element

- **Who Has the Keys?** Review and update the list of individuals authorized to use emergency access credentials. If someone has left the organization or changed roles, remove their authorization.
- **Is the "Break Glass" Plan Still Crystal Clear?** Ensure your documented "emergency break glass" process is current, accurate, and easily accessible. Update it if technology, personnel, or procedures have changed.
- **Training Check:** Confirm that all administrators and security officers who might potentially use these accounts are thoroughly trained on the current process.


### Phase 3: Kick the Tires – Check Account Functionality and Setup

- **Can It Log In?** Validate that each emergency access account can successfully sign in. Discovering a password has expired or an account is locked out during an emergency is a nightmare.
- **Can It Do Its Job?** Confirm these accounts can perform the necessary administrative tasks they are intended for.
- **CRITICAL: No Personal Ties for MFA/SSPR!** Verify that MFA or SSPR for these accounts is **NOT** registered to any individual user's personal device or personal email/phone. This is a common pitfall.
- **Shared MFA Device Due Diligence:**
  - Ensure the device is physically accessible to all administrators who might need it in an emergency.
  - Verify the device has at least **two different network paths** (e.g., Wi-Fi and cellular) to ensure it works even if one path is down.

---

### Phase 4: Physical Security Matters (If Applicable)

- **Safe and Sound:** If credentials or dedicated MFA devices are stored in a physical safe:
  - Change the safe's combination immediately if someone with access leaves the organization.
  - Adhere to your security policy for regular combination changes.


### Phase 5: Document and Report – Closing the Loop

- **Log Everything:** Document that all validation steps have been completed. Use a dedicated log, noting dates, personnel involved, the specific accounts reviewed, whether they were compliant, and any findings or actions taken.

#### Emergency Access Account Validation Log: Your Audit Trail

| Date       | Name of Reviewer | Break Glass Account(s) Reviewed | Compliant (Yes/No) | Notes / Findings / Actions |
|------------|------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| [Date]     | [Reviewer Name]  | emea-admin, corp-breakglass      | Yes                | Accounts tested, login successful. MFA via shared hardware token validated. Documentation reviewed and current. Safe combination last changed [Date]. |
| [Date]     | [Reviewer Name]  | legacy-emergency                 | No                 | Account legacy-emergency SSPR linked to former employee. Link removed. Password rotated. Policy reminder sent re: SSPR for emergency accounts. |


## Secure Today for a Safer Tomorrow

Managing emergency access accounts isn't the most glamorous part of IT security, but it's undeniably one of the most critical.

By implementing robust **technical safeguards** and adhering to a **stringent quarterly review process**, you ensure these powerful accounts remain your trusted allies in a crisis, not a backdoor for threats.

**Don't wait for an emergency to find out your lifeline is broken.**
