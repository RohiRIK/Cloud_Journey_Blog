# Moving Day: Your Fun(ctional) Guide to Migrating from Google Workspace to Microsoft 365

So, you're making the leap! Trading in the GWS suite for the world of Microsoft 365. Exciting times! It's a bit like moving house – you know the new place will be great, but the process? Well, let's just say it involves careful packing, maybe some heavy lifting, and occasionally wondering where you put that one crucial thing.

Fear not, intrepid migrator! While it's a significant project (especially moving from Google Apps to Microsoft Apps, as we're focusing on here), it doesn't have to be a soul-crushing experience. Think of this as your slightly humorous, highly practical guide to navigating the digital move.

## Your Pre-Migration Checklist: Tick 'Em Off!

- [ ] **Scope it Out**: What exactly is coming with you? (Users, Mailboxes, Personal Drives, Shared Drives?)
- [ ] **Choose Your Moving Truck**: Select a migration tool (e.g., AvePoint Fly - check their licensing for mailboxes vs. drives!).
- [ ] **License to Thrill**: Figure out the M365 licenses needed (Office Apps, OneDrive, SharePoint, Exchange Online are key for this GWS swap).
- [ ] **Plant Your Flag**: Add and verify your custom domain(s) in the M365 tenant.
- [ ] **The Grand List**: Create your mapping spreadsheet (Yes, the mighty spreadsheet!) detailing source GWS resource to destination M365 resource.
- [ ] **Build the New House**: Create users in M365 & assign licenses (Mailboxes often auto-provision).
- [ ] **Set Up the Rooms**: Create corresponding Personal Drives (OneDrive) and Shared Drives (SharePoint Sites/Teams).
- [ ] **Assign the Keys**: Add users/owners to SharePoint sites and groups.
- [ ] **Fort Knox Security (Recommended)**:
  - [ ] Set up Conditional Access requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
  - [ ] Block legacy authentication protocols (because security rocks!).
  - [ ] Create Break-Glass admin accounts (and store credentials securely!).
- [ ] **Mark Your Calendar**: Set firm deadlines for:
  - [ ] Finishing preparations.
  - [ ] Starting the full data migration.
  - [ ] Users accessing the new M365 tenant.
  - [ ] DNS cutover (the big one!).
- [ ] **Spread the Word**: Communicate timelines, expectations, and user actions clearly.
- [ ] **Show & Tell**: Demonstrate the new M365 environment.
- [ ] **User Guides (Optional but nice!)**: Create simple onboarding guides.
- [ ] **Final Mapping Check**: Ensure User Mailboxes, Shared Mailboxes, Personal Drives, and Shared Drives/Sites are all mapped correctly in your spreadsheet/tool.

## Phase 1: Reconnaissance & Planning (Measure Twice, Migrate Once)

Before you copy a single byte, you need to know what you're moving and how.

- **Know Your Stuff**: Identify every user, mailbox (don't forget shared ones!), personal drive (soon to be OneDrive!), and shared drive (hello SharePoint/Teams!). Missing something now is much less fun to fix later.
- **Tool Time**: Migrating data manually is… well, nobody has time for that. Tools like AvePoint Fly (which I used) are lifesavers. They automate copying objects between tenants. Do your research, compare features, and understand the licensing – often, mailbox migration is licensed differently than file migration.
- **License Savvy**: Moving from Google Apps means your users will primarily need access to Microsoft Office Apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook), Exchange Online (email), OneDrive (personal files), and SharePoint/Teams (shared files/collaboration). Match M365 licenses (like Business Standard/Premium or Enterprise E3) to these needs. We'll save the joys of adding Intune for device management for another blog post, perhaps?
- **Domain Duty**: Get your company domain (e.g., yourcompany.com) added and verified in your new M365 tenant early. This is crucial for email flow and identity later.
- **Mapping Mania**: Ah, the spreadsheet. Your central source of truth. List every GWS item (user email, drive name) and its corresponding new home in M365. This map guides your migration tool and your sanity.

## Phase 2: Building Your New Digital Abode (Destination Prep)

Time to get the M365 tenant ready for its new inhabitants.

- **User Creation**: Set up user accounts in M365. Once you assign the appropriate license, their mailbox and OneDrive space should automatically start provisioning. Magic! (Or just good automation).
- **Shared Spaces**: Create the SharePoint sites or Teams that will house your migrated Shared Drive content. Add the necessary owners and members so they can validate content later and manage permissions. Remember, permissions management is a gift you give your future self.
- **Security First (Seriously)**:
  - **MFA is Non-Negotiable**: Set up Conditional Access policies to enforce Multi-Factor Authentication. Users will register on their first sign-in. It’s a small hurdle for a massive security gain.
  - **Block the Old Ways**: Disable legacy authentication protocols (like POP, IMAP, SMTP AUTH for basic auth). These are common attack vectors. Just turn them off. You can do it!
  - **Break-Glass**: Create 2-3 emergency admin accounts that bypass MFA (using strong, unique passwords stored offline and securely). Hope you never need them, but be glad you have them if you do.

## Phase 3: Setting the Stage & Rallying the Troops (Comms & Readiness)

A migration's success isn't just technical; it's about the people.

- **Deadlines are Your Friend**: Set clear, realistic deadlines for key milestones (prep complete, migration start, cutover, etc.). Stick to them as much as possible.
- **Communicate Clearly & Often**: Tell your employees what's happening, why, when, and what they need to do. Avoid surprises! Use multiple channels if needed.
- **Demo Day**: Show users what M365 looks like. A little familiarity goes a long way in easing anxiety.
- **Helpful Guides**: Simple "How to log in," "Where are my files," or "Using Outlook" guides can reduce helpdesk calls significantly.

## Phase 4: The Great Data Convoy (Migration Time!)

The moment of truth – moving the data.

- **Full Sync First**: Use your chosen tool to perform the initial full copy of mailboxes and drives. This copies the bulk of the data. Grab a coffee; this might take a while depending on volume.
- **Spot Checks**: Once done, do some quick checks. Did key mailboxes copy? Are major shared drives showing up? A quick sanity check can catch big issues early.
- **Welcome to Microsoft**: Guide users on accessing M365, downloading, and installing the Office client apps (if applicable).
- **Incremental Syncs**: Run incremental syncs regularly (daily or even more frequently) leading up to cutover. This copies any new emails or changed files, keeping the M365 side up-to-date.

## Phase 5: Flipping the Switch (DNS - Where the Fun Begins!)

Okay, "fun" might be subjective here. This is the critical cutover point, usually done after hours or over a weekend.

- **The MX Record Shuffle**: This is the big one. Changing your domain's MX (Mail Exchanger) record tells the internet to start delivering new email to M365 instead of Google Workspace. Double-check. Triple-check. Then check again before hitting save. Propagation takes time (minutes to hours).
- **SPF & DKIM**: Update your SPF (Sender Policy Framework) record to authorize M365 servers to send email for your domain. Set up DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) in M365 and publish the DNS record. These are crucial for email deliverability and preventing spoofing.
- **Autodiscover**: Ensure your Autodiscover CNAME record points correctly so Outlook clients can automatically configure themselves.
- **Breathe & Troubleshoot**: Things happen. DNS changes can be finicky. Allocate specific time after the change for troubleshooting email flow or client connection issues. It’s normal. Stay calm and diagnose methodically.

## Phase 6: The Aftermath & Clean-Up (Post-Migration)

You've done it! Mail is flowing, files are syncing. Almost time for pizza.

- **Keep Troubleshooting**: Be available for user questions and minor issues that pop up post-cutover.
- **Lock the Old Doors**: Once you're confident M365 is stable and data is verified, restrict or completely block access to the old Google Workspace tenant to prevent confusion and ensure adoption of the new platform.

## Wrapping Up

Migrating from Google Workspace to Microsoft 365 is a marathon, not a sprint. There will be technical hurdles, unexpected quirks, and maybe a few moments where you question your life choices (just kidding... mostly!). But with careful planning, the right tools, clear communication, and a dash of humor, it's entirely achievable.

You're not just moving data; you're paving the way for new collaboration and productivity possibilities. So, take a deep breath, trust your checklist, and good luck with your digital move! You've got this.
