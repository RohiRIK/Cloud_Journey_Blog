# Project: Cloud Journey Blog

## Directory Overview

This directory contains the source code for the "Cloud Journey Blog," a personal blog focused on cloud computing, automation, and cybersecurity. The content is written in Markdown and organized into `blogs` and `guides`.

The blog covers a range of topics, including:
*   **Azure:** Virtual Machine security, Entra ID, Logic Apps, and more.
*   **Automation:** Scripts and workflows for automating tasks on macOS and with tools like n8n.
*   **Security:** Guides on migrating to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and other security topics.
*   **Git & GitHub:** Introductory guides to version control.

## Key Files

*   `README.md`: Provides a high-level overview of the project, its purpose, and content.
*   `IDEAS.md`: A document outlining future improvements and ideas for the custom commands used to create blog content.
*   `blogs/`: This directory contains all the blog posts, which are organized into subdirectories based on their topics (e.g., `azure`, `security`, `automation`).
*   `guides/`: This directory holds more detailed guides and playbooks, such as the "Threat Explorer Playbook for Phishing Response."
*   `LICENSE`: The MIT License file for the project.

## Usage

The primary purpose of this directory is to manage the source content for a personal blog. The Markdown files are likely processed by a static site generator (such as Jekyll or Hugo, as hinted in `IDEAS.md`) to build the final blog website. The content is created and organized using custom commands like `/create_blog_post` and `/create_guide`.
