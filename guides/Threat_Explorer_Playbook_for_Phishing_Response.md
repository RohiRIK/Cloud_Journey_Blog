### Role Objectives

- SOC: Triage alerts, confirm scope, initiate containment, escalate with evidence
- IR: Lead scoping and eradication, coordinate approvals, finalize reports and lessons learned

### Prerequisites and Access

- Licensing: Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 is required for the full Threat Explorer feature set. Plan 1 provides Real‚Äëtime detections only.
- Entry points:
    - Threat Explorer: https://security.microsoft.com/threatexplorerv3`
    - Real‚Äëtime detections: https://security.microsoft.com/realtimereportsv3`

### Phase 1: Prepare the Investigation Surface

### 1. Open Threat Explorer

1. Sign in to the Microsoft Defender portal at https://security.microsoft.com`.
2. Navigate to Email & collaboration ‚Üí Explorer.
3. Select the Phish view.

### 2. Establish Scope and Baselines

- Time range: Use Yesterday‚ÄìToday for routine monitoring. For incident scoping, set a custom range (up to 30 days).
- Core filters:
    - Basic: Sender address, Recipient, Subject, Sender domain
    - Advanced: Internet message ID, Network message ID, Sender IP
    - URL: Click verdict, URL domain, URL threat type
    - Authentication: SPF, DKIM, DMARC status

### Phase 2: Identify and Analyze Campaigns

### 1. Hunt for Impersonation and Targeting

- User impersonation: Detection Technology ‚Üí Equal any of ‚Üí Impersonation domain, Impersonation user ‚Üí Refresh
- Domain impersonation: Basic ‚Üí Impersonated Domain ‚Üí [contoso.com](http://contoso.com) ‚Üí Refresh
- Executive targeting: Impersonated User ‚Üí [user@domain.com](mailto:user@domain.com)[, [user2@domain.com](mailto:user2@domain.com)] ‚Üí Refresh

### 2. Examine Message Details

- Use Email view. Customize columns to include Date, Subject, Recipient, Sender, Threat type, Detection technology, Delivery action, Final delivery location, Alert ID, Network message ID, URL count.
- Open a message via Subject to access:
    - Open Email Entity
    - View header
    - Take action
    - Email preview and Download email (Preview role required)

### Phase 3: URL and Click Analysis

### 1. Investigate Malicious URLs

- Verdict filter: Blocked, Blocked overridden, Pending verdict
- Pivot views:
    - Top URLs: Prevalent malicious links
    - Top Clicks: User interaction with Safe Links
- URL entity details: Original URL, Threat intelligence verdict, Active alerts, Domain registration, URL prevalence

### 2. Export Click Telemetry

- Select rows ‚Üí Export ‚Üí CSV includes Network message ID, Click verdict, Timestamps

### Phase 4: Advanced Threat Hunting

### 1. Leverage Detection Technologies

- Examples: Impersonation brand, URL detonation, LLM content analysis, Mail bombing, Spoof DMARC
- Combine operators (Equal any of, Contains, Does not equal) and save frequent searches in Threat Explorer.

### 2. Use Analytical Pivots

- Charts: Delivery action, Sender domain, Detection technology, Threat classification
- Interactions: Hover for counts, click to filter, export underlying data

### Phase 5: Response and Containment

### 1. Execute Remediation

- In list view: Select messages ‚Üí Take action (wizard)
- Options:
    - Submit to Microsoft (tune detections)
    - Trigger investigation (AIR playbook)
    - Delete or Quarantine
- AIR scope: Looks back 30 days, correlates similar artifacts, and automates analysis and responses

### 2. Track Remediation and Approvals

- Action center: https://security.microsoft.com/action-center`
    - Pending actions (approval queue)
    - Investigation history
    - Remediation status

### Phase 6: Reporting and Evidence Management

### 1. Export Investigation Results

- Up to 200,000 filtered email results per export
- Choose columns, export to CSV for downstream analytics

### 2. Produce Executive and SOC Summaries

- Top targeted users (up to 3,000)
- URL click analysis with Network message IDs
- Chart data exports for trend reporting
- Reuse saved filters for continuous monitoring

### Operational Best Practices

- Daily cadence:
    - Review Phish view
    - Monitor top targeted users
    - Track URL click trends
    - Inspect detection technology distribution
- Investigation workflow:
    - Start broad, then narrow
    - Use chart pivots to reveal patterns
    - Deep‚Äëdive via Email entity
    - Export data to preserve evidence and metrics
- Integrations and tuning:
    - Stream Explorer data into Microsoft Sentinel for SIEM correlation
    - Use AIR for large or fast‚Äëmoving campaigns
    - Feed click telemetry into user awareness programs
    - Tune policies based on observed gaps
